# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael

## About Me
I recently completed AI Coreâ€™s Data Analytics bootcamp and am looking to get more into this field. I really enjoy problem solving and building cool things, so watch this space!

Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning Methods using Tensorflow 2.0 on Udemy! Iâ€™ve also got React Native and Javascript on my bucket list for this year, once my Python skills are top notch.

Iâ€™m currently working as an Application Physicist at Innovative Physics, where I build and run physics simulations to help develop experimental radiation detection equipment. I also work in a team developing calibration scripts in python to get gamma cameras working. You can take a look at some of these physics models on my personal page, but the business sensitive stuff is hidden, sorry!

## Skills and Languages
- **Languages:** Python, M Query, C++, SQL
- **Skills:** Data Science and Analytics, Business Analysis, Statistical Modelling, Geant4


## Projects I'm Currently Working On
### Detect and Locate Model
Geant4 project to model the angular response of four scintillator detectors in various configurations, with events generated from a radioactive source moved around the environment.
