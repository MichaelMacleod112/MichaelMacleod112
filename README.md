# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael

## About Me
I'm currently an application physicist at Innovative Physics where I build and run physics simulations to help develop experimental radiation detection equipment. I also work in a team developing calibration scripts and algorithms in python to get gamma cameras working.
I recently completed AI Coreâ€™s Data Analytics bootcamp and am looking to get more into this field. I really enjoy problem solving and building cool things, so watch this space!

Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning Methods using Tensorflow 2.0 on Udemy! Iâ€™ve also got React Native and Javascript on my bucket list for this year, once my Python skills are top notch.

## Skills and Languages
- **Languages:** Python, M Query, C++, SQL
- **Skills:** Data Science and Analytics, Business Analysis, Statistical Modelling, Geant4


## Projects I'm Currently Working On

### Boxmaze game
Currently a prototype, this is a fun game I thought up and coded out in python. I'm working on developing a level generator algorithm before making the code available and expanding the scope.

### Detect and Locate Model
Geant4 project to model the angular response of four scintillator detectors in various configurations. Simulates gamma and x-ray physics, with events generated from a radioactive source moved around the environment.
